# password-manager
A small password managing application that I wrote in Python using the TkInter library for my Grade 11 Computer Science Final Summative.

Users can save accounts tied to a service, username and password, which are then saved and can later be retrieved by filling the "Service" entry box with the existing account service.

The application follows a specific scoring criteria that takes into consideration:

  -Presence of numbers, symbols and uppercase letters
  
  -Presence of consecutive lower- or uppercase letters
  
  -Repetitions of the same character

The application also provides a password generation feature which will create a random password that meets all the guidelines for a 100-scored password.

Message boxes are used to communicate help, errors and changes to the user.
